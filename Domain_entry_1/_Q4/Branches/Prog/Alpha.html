        <div class="side b-b common-text" > HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are the three core technologies used in web development. Here's a brief history of each:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. HTML:
               - HTML was first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 as a way to share documents among scientists.
               - HTML 1.0 was introduced in 1991, offering basic elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists.
               - HTML 2.0 was released in 1995, adding new features such as forms and tables.
               - HTML 3.2 (1997) introduced support for more styling and layout options.
               - HTML 4.01 (1999) provided better support for scripting languages and multimedia.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. CSS:
               - CSS was introduced to separate document content from presentation.
               - CSS1 was published in 1996, allowing for basic styling of HTML elements.
               - CSS2 (1998) expanded the capabilities of CSS, introducing features like positioning and media types.
               - CSS3, a modular version of CSS, started development in the late 1990s and is still being expanded with new features and modules.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. JavaScript:
               - JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications.
               - It was originally named Mocha, then LiveScript, before finally settling on JavaScript.
               - JavaScript gained popularity due to its ability to add interactivity to web pages.
               - ECMAScript, the standardized version of JavaScript, was first published in 1997 (ECMAScript 1), and subsequent versions have introduced new features and enhancements.
            
            Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of the modern web, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive websites and web applications.</div>

           Programming.. a truly wonderful thing to exist in this world... allowing humans to communicate with the machine/computer by 
           <br>
           Making telling the machine instructions easier... this Process is called "Compiling" and "Interpreting"
           The process of <code>Compiling</code> is Turning the words put by the developers to an <code>Interpretable</code> sequence of instruction... 
           <br>
           The next process s called <code>Interpreting</code>...
           Interpreting is a process which
           <br>
            turns the compiled code to an instruction that Machines can understand
